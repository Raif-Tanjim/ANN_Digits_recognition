# ANN_Digits_recognition
A digit recognition model using Artificial neural network

At first we import a prebuid data set from tensorflow.keras
THen we split the data as train and test for bulding the model
we then reshape the train data into 28 /28 [pixels format ]


then the model is created by using tensor flow
and we fit the train datas in the model 
then we can evalute the model to know the score of it
we also add hidden layers in the 2nd attemt to show improvment of score
then we try checking with different parameters to find the best result within the neural network model
then we check the model with the image to see how the model performs
